# Intro Project Analysis and Context

## Available Documentation Analysis

A comprehensive `brownfield-architecture.md` document exists and serves as the primary source of technical documentation. It covers:

* **Tech Stack**: Complete list of technologies and versions.
* **Source Tree/Architecture**: Detailed project structure and key module descriptions.
* **API Documentation**: Key internal and external API endpoints.
* **Technical Debt**: Known issues and workarounds are clearly documented.

## Enhancement Scope Definition

* **Enhancement Type**: New Feature Addition & Major Feature Modification (Security).
* **Enhancement Description**: The enhancement involves creating a Membership Reconciliation Dashboard to streamline payment verification from Lloyds Bank and Stripe, overhauling the security and authentication system, and integrating with WordPress to automate member role management.
* **Impact Assessment**: **Significant Impact**, as this involves a major new feature, foundational security changes, and a new external system integration.

## Goals and Background Context

* **Goals**: To reduce administrative reconciliation time by over 90%; improve membership data accuracy in GHL and WordPress to over 99%; eliminate revenue loss from incorrect benefit assignment; and implement a robust, secure authentication and data handling foundation.
* **Background Context**: The current manual reconciliation process is error-prone, leading to inaccurate member data in GHL. This inaccuracy directly impacts member benefits managed in WordPress, causing revenue loss and a poor member experience. This project replaces that manual process with a secure, reliable, and semi-automated dashboard.
