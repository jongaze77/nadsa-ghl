# Story 1.4: Fix EmailService Test Environment Configuration

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** Developer maintaining the codebase,
**I want** the EmailService test suite to pass consistently by fixing environment variable configuration conflicts,
**so that** the continuous integration pipeline remains reliable and the test suite accurately validates security notification functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. All EmailService tests must pass without environment variable configuration conflicts
2. The test setup must properly isolate environment variables between test suites
3. The Jest configuration must handle static configuration loading in the EmailService class
4. The test mocking strategy must be consistent and not interfere with other test suites
5. No existing functionality or tests should be broken by the fixes
6. The solution must maintain backward compatibility with existing test patterns
7. All test configuration changes must be documented and maintainable

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Analyze and fix EmailService static configuration issue (AC: 1, 3)
  - [x] Investigate why EmailService static config doesn't respect test environment overrides
  - [x] Implement solution to reload configuration during tests (dependency injection or config refresh)
  - [x] Ensure configuration changes don't impact production code performance
  - [x] Verify test isolation between different test suites

- [x] Task 2: Fix Jest environment variable setup conflicts (AC: 2, 4)
  - [x] Review jest.setup.js global environment configuration
  - [x] Resolve conflicts between global setup and per-test environment overrides
  - [x] Implement proper environment variable isolation strategy
  - [x] Test cross-suite environment variable isolation

- [x] Task 3: Resolve test mocking inconsistencies (AC: 4, 5)
  - [x] Fix nodemailer mock setup to work consistently across test runs
  - [x] Ensure mock transporter calls are properly tracked and accessible
  - [x] Verify console spy expectations align with actual EmailService behavior
  - [x] Test mock reset and cleanup between test cases

- [x] Task 4: Validate all test suites pass together (AC: 5, 6)
  - [x] Run complete test suite to ensure no regressions
  - [x] Verify AuthService and SecurityNotificationService tests remain unaffected
  - [x] Test that database-dependent tests are properly skipped in CI environment
  - [x] Validate that all existing test patterns continue to work

- [x] Task 5: Document test configuration patterns (AC: 7)
  - [x] Document the EmailService testing pattern for future reference
  - [x] Update jest.setup.js with clear comments about environment variable handling
  - [x] Create testing guidelines for services with static configuration
  - [x] Document best practices for test environment isolation

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**Key learnings from Story 1.2 Implementation** [Source: docs/stories/1.2.security-notifications.md]:
- EmailService was implemented with static configuration loaded at module initialization time
- Jest test environment variables are set up globally in jest.setup.js but conflict with per-test overrides
- The testing pattern established 40+ test cases for comprehensive security notification coverage
- Environment-configurable notification settings are critical for production deployment

**Identified Issues from Story 1.3 Implementation**:
- EmailService tests failing due to static configuration not respecting test environment overrides
- Environment variables set in jest.setup.js conflict with beforeEach() overrides in EmailService.test.ts
- Mock transporter calls not being properly tracked, causing test assertions to fail
- Console spy expectations not matching actual EmailService logging behavior

### Technical Context
**Current Test Infrastructure** [Source: jest.config.js, jest.setup.js]:
- Using Next.js Jest configuration with jsdom environment
- Global environment variables set in jest.setup.js for NextAuth and database
- Email service configured with defaults but tests expect to override environment variables
- Module transformation configured for ES modules (jose, openid-client)

**EmailService Architecture** [Source: src/lib/EmailService.ts]:
- Static configuration object loaded at module initialization
- Private static transporter instance cached for performance
- Environment variables: EMAIL_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED, SMTP_HOST, SMTP_PORT, etc.
- Configuration includes security-sensitive SMTP credentials

### Test Configuration Requirements
**Jest Environment Setup** [Source: jest.setup.js]:
- Current global setup provides base environment variables
- EmailService tests require per-test environment variable overrides
- Need proper isolation between test suites to prevent cross-contamination
- Mock objects must be properly reset between test runs

**EmailService Testing Pattern** [Source: src/__tests__/lib/EmailService.test.ts]:
- Tests use beforeEach() to set specific environment variables for each test scenario
- Expects mockTransporter.sendMail to be called with specific parameters
- Uses console spies to verify logging behavior
- Tests various email configuration scenarios (enabled/disabled, different SMTP settings)

### File Locations
**Files to Modify**:
- src/lib/EmailService.ts - Fix static configuration handling for tests
- jest.setup.js - Improve environment variable isolation strategy
- src/__tests__/lib/EmailService.test.ts - Fix test setup and expectations if needed
- jest.config.js - Adjust configuration if required for test isolation

**Testing Requirements from Architecture**:
- Follow Jest & React Testing Library patterns established in Story 1.2
- Maintain test file location in src/__tests__/ directory structure
- Ensure comprehensive test coverage for security-critical email notification functionality
- Follow error handling and edge case testing patterns from existing test suites

### Performance and Integration Considerations
**Test Performance** [Source: docs/architecture/enhancement-scope-and-integration-strategy.md]:
- Test configuration changes must not impact test execution speed
- Static configuration optimization in production code must be preserved
- Environment variable handling should not introduce performance overhead

**Integration Impact** [Source: docs/architecture/enhancement-scope-and-integration-strategy.md]:
- Must not introduce breaking changes to existing test patterns
- All database interactions continue to use existing patterns
- Changes must be backward compatible with established testing workflows

## Testing

### Testing Standards
**Framework**: Jest & React Testing Library [Source: Story 1.2 - established testing foundation]
**Test Location**: src/__tests__/ following established patterns from SecurityNotificationService tests  
**Coverage Requirements**: All EmailService tests must pass while maintaining comprehensive coverage of email notification functionality

**Required Test Cases**:
- Fix environment variable configuration conflicts in EmailService test suite
- Verify proper test isolation between different service test files  
- Ensure mock transporter setup works consistently across test runs
- Validate console spy expectations match actual EmailService behavior
- Test that configuration changes don't impact other test suites
- Confirm all existing test patterns remain functional after fixes

**Test Validation Approach**:
- Run full test suite multiple times to verify consistent results
- Test with both Jest individual file execution and full suite runs
- Validate that CI/CD environment can execute tests successfully
- Ensure test configuration is maintainable and well-documented
