# Introduction

This document outlines the architectural approach for enhancing the NADSA GHL Client Manager with a new Membership Reconciliation Dashboard and security overhaul. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development of the new features, ensuring seamless and secure integration with the existing system.

## Existing Project Analysis

  * **Current Project State**: The application is a monolithic Next.js **15.1.0** application using the App Router, with a PostgreSQL database managed by Prisma **6.9.0**. It serves as a custom admin UI for managing GoHighLevel (GHL) contacts.
  * **Available Documentation**: The primary technical reference is the `brownfield-architecture.md` document, which details the existing system's state prior to this enhancement.
  * **Identified Constraints**: The new solution must operate within the existing Next.js/Vercel architecture. A key constraint is the build process's current configuration to ignore TypeScript and ESLint errors, which must be rectified as part of this enhancement.
