# Story 1.1: Brute-Force Protection Implementation

## Status
Done

## Story

**As a** System Administrator,
**I want** brute-force protection implemented for the NextAuth authentication system,
**so that** unauthorized users cannot repeatedly attempt login attacks against admin and user accounts, protecting the system from security breaches.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The system must implement account lockout functionality that temporarily disables login attempts after a configurable number of failed attempts (default: 5 attempts)
2. Lockout duration must be configurable with a default of 15 minutes
3. Failed login attempts must be tracked per username/account
4. The system must provide clear feedback to users when their account is locked due to failed attempts
5. Lockout tracking must persist across server restarts
6. The system must automatically unlock accounts after the lockout period expires
7. Implementation must not break existing NextAuth functionality or user experience

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Extend User model for lockout tracking (AC: 1, 5)
  - [x] Add failedLoginAttempts field to User model
  - [x] Add lockedUntil field to User model  
  - [x] Create and run Prisma migration for schema changes
  - [x] Update TypeScript types and Prisma client generation

- [x] Task 2: Implement brute-force protection logic (AC: 1, 2, 3, 6)
  - [x] Create AuthService.ts with lockout management functions
  - [x] Implement incrementFailedAttempts function
  - [x] Implement resetFailedAttempts function
  - [x] Implement isAccountLocked function with configurable timeout
  - [x] Add configuration constants for attempt limits and lockout duration

- [x] Task 3: Integrate protection into NextAuth authorize function (AC: 1, 4, 7)
  - [x] Modify auth.ts authorize function to check account lockout status
  - [x] Increment failed attempts on authentication failure
  - [x] Reset failed attempts on successful authentication
  - [x] Return appropriate error messages for locked accounts
  - [x] Ensure existing functionality remains unchanged

- [x] Task 4: Add unit tests for brute-force protection (Testing Requirements)
  - [x] Test lockout after configured failed attempts
  - [x] Test automatic unlock after timeout period
  - [x] Test successful login resets attempt counter
  - [x] Test lockout persistence across different authentication attempts
  - [x] Test edge cases and boundary conditions

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous story insights available - this is the first story in the epic.

### Data Models
**Current User Model** [Source: prisma/schema.prisma]:
- id: Int @id @default(autoincrement())  
- username: String @unique
- password: String
- role: String @default("user")
- createdAt: DateTime @default(now())

**Required Schema Extensions**:
- failedLoginAttempts: Int @default(0) - Track consecutive failed login attempts
- lockedUntil: DateTime? - Timestamp when account lockout expires (null when not locked)

### Authentication Integration  
**Current NextAuth Configuration** [Source: src/lib/auth.ts]:
- Uses CredentialsProvider with username/password
- Authorize function queries User model via Prisma
- Uses bcrypt.compare for password validation
- Returns user object with id, name, role for successful authentication
- Session strategy: JWT with 24-hour expiry

### Component Specifications
**New AuthService Component** [Source: architecture/component-architecture.md#backend-services-in]:
- Location: src/lib/AuthService.ts (enhancements to existing auth system)
- Purpose: Centralized brute-force protection logic
- Integration: Called from NextAuth authorize function

### File Locations
**Files to Modify**:
- src/lib/auth.ts - Integrate brute-force checks into authorize function
- prisma/schema.prisma - Add lockout fields to User model

**Files to Create**:
- src/lib/AuthService.ts - Brute-force protection service
- Migration file via `npx prisma migrate dev` - Database schema changes

### Technical Constraints
**Framework Versions** [Source: architecture/tech-stack-alignment.md]:
- NextAuth: 4.24.11 - Will be reconfigured and enhanced
- Prisma: 6.13.0 - Handling schema migration and data access  
- TypeScript: 5.9.2 - All new code will be written in TypeScript

**Integration Requirements** [Source: architecture/enhancement-scope-and-integration-strategy.md]:
- Must not introduce breaking changes to existing APIs
- Database schema changes must be backward compatible via incremental migrations
- Must not negatively impact performance of current application

### Security Requirements
- Lockout configuration should be environment-based for flexibility
- Failed attempt tracking must be accurate and tamper-resistant
- Error messages should not reveal whether username exists (security best practice)
- Account lockout must be persistent across server restarts

## Testing

### Testing Standards
**Framework**: Jest & React Testing Library [Source: architecture/tech-stack-alignment.md#new-technology-additions]
**Purpose**: Component and Unit Testing to fulfill new testing requirement
**Test Location**: Following existing project structure (to be determined based on current test setup)

**Required Test Cases**:
- Unit tests for AuthService functions
- Integration tests for NextAuth authorize function with lockout logic  
- Database persistence tests for lockout state
- Configuration validation tests
- Error handling and edge case tests
