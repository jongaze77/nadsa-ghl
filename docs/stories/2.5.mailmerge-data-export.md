# Story 2.5: Mailmerge Data Export

## Status
Done

## Story

**As a** System Administrator,
**I want** a mailmerge data export feature that generates CSV files with name, address, membership type (single/double), and renewal date information for contacts with Full and Associate membership types,
**so that** I can efficiently create physical mailings and marketing materials using standard mailmerge tools with properly formatted contact data.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Add new export option to the existing Admin Data Import/Export page for "Mailmerge Data Export"
2. Filter contacts where `membershipType IN ("Full", "Associate")` 
3. Export CSV with columns: `title`, `initial`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `address_line_1`, `address_line_2`, `address_line_3`, `city`, `state`, `postal_code`, `country`, `membership_type`, `single_or_double`, `renewal_date`
4. Map `title` column from custom field `xNIBnbcu4NJ008JLUWGF` with values like "Mr", "Ms", "Dr", etc
5. Map `single_or_double` column from custom field `hJQPtsVDFBxI1USEN83v` with values "Single" or "Double"
6. Map `renewal_date` column from custom field `cWMPNiNAfReHOumOhBB2` or extracted field `renewal_date`
7. Include address fields: `address1` → `address_line_1`, custom field `PEyv7RkguJ3IwYQdQlkR` → `address_line_2`, custom field `dTKWIDeFBg9MI1MQ65vi` → `address_line_3`, `city`, `state`, `postalCode` → `postal_code`, `country`
8. Handle missing address fields gracefully with empty strings in CSV
9. Provide export preview showing count of contacts that match the criteria
10. Include proper error handling for export operations with user feedback
11. Maintain consistent UI/UX patterns with existing WordPress export functionality
12. Generate CSV file with appropriate filename: `mailmerge-export-YYYY-MM-DD.csv`
13. Include `initial` field calculated from first letter of first name (uppercase)
14. Sort data by last name (primary) then first name (secondary)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**Key learnings from Story 2.3** [Source: Story 2.3 implementation]:
- Admin export functionality successfully established at `/admin/data-import-export` with proper middleware protection
- Export service pattern in `src/lib/export-service.ts` provides solid foundation for additional export types
- Custom field access pattern: `getCustomFieldValue(contact.customFields, fieldId)` works for array structure
- CSV generation with `convertToCSV()` and `escapeCsvField()` utility functions provide robust CSV handling
- API route pattern at `/api/admin/export/{type}/route.ts` established for export endpoints
- UI patterns for export preview, loading states, and error handling successfully implemented

### Database Schema and Contact Model
**Contact Model Structure** [Source: prisma/schema.prisma]:
- Standard address fields available: `address1`, `address2`, `city`, `state`, `postalCode`, `country`
- Membership type field: `membershipType` (string) - filter on "Full" and "Associate"
- Custom fields accessed via JSON: `customFields` column stores array structure
- Extracted renewal date: `renewal_date` field (string) extracted from custom field `cWMPNiNAfReHOumOhBB2`
- Custom field IDs: `hJQPtsVDFBxI1USEN83v` for single/double membership, `cWMPNiNAfReHOumOhBB2` for renewal date

### Existing Export Service Architecture
**Export Service Patterns** [Source: src/lib/export-service.ts]:
- Service location: `src/lib/export-service.ts` - extend for mailmerge functionality
- Custom field helper: `getCustomFieldValue(customFields, fieldId)` function for array structure access
- Filtering pattern: Prisma queries with `where` conditions and post-processing filters
- CSV generation: `convertToCSV()` with proper escaping via `escapeCsvField()` utility
- Interface pattern: Define export interfaces like `MailmergeContact` similar to `WordPressUser`
- Error handling: Try/catch blocks with console logging and thrown errors for API handling

### API Route Architecture
**Admin Export API Patterns** [Source: Story 2.3 implementation]:
- Route location: `/api/admin/export/mailmerge-data/route.ts` following established pattern
- Authentication: NextAuth token verification with admin role check
- Response format: CSV file download with appropriate `Content-Type` and `Content-Disposition` headers
- Error responses: JSON structure with appropriate HTTP status codes
- File naming: Include timestamp in filename for uniqueness and organization

### Custom Field Mapping Requirements
**GHL Field Integration** [Source: src/lib/ghl-api.ts and Story 2.3]:
- `hJQPtsVDFBxI1USEN83v`: Maps to single/double membership selection
- `cWMPNiNAfReHOumOhBB2`: Maps to renewal date field
- Access pattern: `contact.customFields` is array structure, use `getCustomFieldValue()` helper
- Fallback strategy: Try extracted `renewal_date` field first, then customFields for `cWMPNiNAfReHOumOhBB2`
- Data validation: Handle null/undefined values and invalid date formats gracefully

### Address Field Handling
**Address Data Structure** [Source: Contact model]:
- Standard fields: `address1`, `address2`, `city`, `state`, `postalCode`, `country`
- Mapping: `address1` → `address_line_1`, `address2` → `address_line_2`, `postalCode` → `postal_code`
- Null handling: Empty string values in CSV for missing address components
- International support: Country field included for global address formats

### UI Integration Requirements
**Admin Page Enhancement** [Source: Story 2.3 implementation]:
- Existing page: `/admin/data-import-export` - add mailmerge export section
- Component pattern: Follow existing export button and preview components
- State management: Loading, success, and error states following established patterns
- Styling: Consistent Tailwind CSS utility classes and responsive design
- User feedback: Success messages, error alerts, and export progress indicators

### File Structure for Implementation
**Files to Extend** [Source: Existing codebase]:
- `src/app/admin/data-import-export/page.tsx` - Add mailmerge export section
- `src/lib/export-service.ts` - Add mailmerge filtering and CSV generation functions
- `src/__tests__/lib/export-service.test.ts` - Add mailmerge export test cases

**New Files Required**:
- `src/app/api/admin/export/mailmerge-data/route.ts` - Mailmerge export API endpoint

### Mailmerge CSV Format Specification
**Column Structure** [Source: User requirements]:
1. `title` - From custom field `xNIBnbcu4NJ008JLUWGF` (Mr, Ms, Dr, etc)
2. `initial` - Calculated from first letter of first name (uppercase)
3. `first_name` - Contact firstName field
4. `last_name` - Contact lastName field  
5. `address_line_1` - Contact address1 field
6. `address_line_2` - From custom field `PEyv7RkguJ3IwYQdQlkR` (Address Line 2)
7. `address_line_3` - From custom field `dTKWIDeFBg9MI1MQ65vi` (Address Line 3)
8. `city` - Contact city field
9. `state` - Contact state field
10. `postal_code` - Contact postalCode field
11. `country` - Contact country field
12. `membership_type` - Contact membershipType field ("Full" or "Associate")
13. `single_or_double` - From custom field `hJQPtsVDFBxI1USEN83v`
14. `renewal_date` - From extracted field or custom field `cWMPNiNAfReHOumOhBB2`
