# Story 1.3: Prisma Schema Bank Account Hashing

## Status
Done

## Story

**As a** System Administrator,
**I want** the Prisma schema updated to securely store hashed bank account numbers for payment reconciliation,
**so that** I can enable secure payment matching while protecting sensitive financial data according to privacy requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The database schema must support secure storage of hashed bank account identifiers without storing original account numbers
2. The system must include data models for tracking payment reconciliation audit trails
3. Database schema changes must be backward compatible and applied via incremental Prisma migrations
4. All new data models must include appropriate indexes for efficient querying during reconciliation operations
5. The implementation must comply with NFR2 requirement that bank account numbers are immediately hashed and original values discarded
6. The schema must support duplicate transaction detection through unique transaction fingerprints
7. All database modifications must be reversible and not impact existing application functionality

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**Key learnings from Story 1.2** [Source: docs/stories/1.2.security-notifications.md]:
- Prisma schema modifications successful using incremental approach with `npx prisma db push`
- SecurityEvent model integration established patterns for new model relationships
- Database indexes critical for query performance (userId, timestamp, ipAddress, eventType)
- Foreign key relationships properly established between User and SecurityEvent models
- Prisma client generation workflow: schema update → migration → client generation

### Data Models
**Current Schema Structure** [Source: prisma/schema.prisma]:
- User model: id (Int, autoincrement), username (String, unique), password, role, timestamps
- Contact model: id (String), contact fields, customFields (Json), GHL integration fields
- SecurityEvent model: Recently added with proper relationships and indexes

**Required New Models** [Source: docs/architecture/data-models-and-schema-changes.md]:

**PaymentSource Model**:
- id: String @id @default(cuid())
- hashedIdentifier: String @unique (for hashed bank account numbers)
- sourceType: String (e.g., 'bank_account', 'stripe_source')
- contactId: String (foreign key to Contact)
- createdAt: DateTime @default(now())
- updatedAt: DateTime @updatedAt
- contact: Contact @relation(fields: [contactId], references: [id])

**ReconciliationLog Model**:
- id: String @id @default(cuid())
- transactionFingerprint: String @unique (for duplicate detection)
- paymentDate: DateTime
- amount: Decimal @db.Money (precise decimal for financial data)
- source: String (e.g., 'lloyds_bank', 'stripe')
- transactionRef: String (original transaction reference)
- reconciledAt: DateTime @default(now())
- reconciledByUserId: Int (foreign key to User)
- contactId: String (foreign key to Contact)
- metadata: Json? (additional transaction context)
- reconciledBy: User @relation(fields: [reconciledByUserId], references: [id])
- contact: Contact @relation(fields: [contactId], references: [id])

### Transaction Fingerprint Strategy
**Duplicate Detection Logic** [Source: docs/architecture/data-models-and-schema-changes.md]:
- **Stripe Reports**: Use unique `source_id` as fingerprint
- **Bank CSVs**: Generate hash from combined Transaction date + Credit Amount + Transaction Description
- **Import Logic**: Check ReconciliationLog.transactionFingerprint before processing new transactions

### Database Integration Requirements
**Schema Integration Strategy** [Source: docs/architecture/data-models-and-schema-changes.md]:
- Two new tables (ReconciliationLog, PaymentSource) added to existing schema
- No modifications to existing tables required (backward compatible)
- Single Prisma migration file for all changes
- Unique index on ReconciliationLog(transactionFingerprint)
- Index on PaymentSource(hashedIdentifier)

**Technology Constraints** [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack-alignment.md]:
- Prisma: 6.13.0 - Database ORM for handling schema migration and data access
- PostgreSQL database with existing User and Contact tables
- TypeScript: 5.9.2 - All new code written in TypeScript with proper typing

### File Locations
**Files to Modify**:
- prisma/schema.prisma - Add new PaymentSource and ReconciliationLog models
- Migration file via `npx prisma migrate dev --name add-reconciliation-models`

**Integration Requirements** [Source: docs/architecture/enhancement-scope-and-integration-strategy.md]:
- Database schema changes must be backward compatible via incremental migrations
- All database interactions continue using existing Prisma client (src/lib/prisma.ts)
- Must not introduce breaking changes to existing APIs or functionality

### Privacy and Security Requirements
**Data Privacy Compliance** [Source: docs/prd/requirements.md]:
- **NFR2**: Bank account numbers must be immediately hashed, original values discarded
- Only hashed identifiers stored in PaymentSource.hashedIdentifier field
- **NFR1**: Balance fields must never be stored (not applicable to this story but related context)

### Performance Considerations
- Unique indexes on frequently queried fields (transactionFingerprint, hashedIdentifier)
- Composite indexes for common reconciliation query patterns
- Efficient relationship queries between Contact, PaymentSource, and ReconciliationLog

## Testing

### Testing Standards
**Framework**: Jest & React Testing Library [Source: Story 1.2 - established testing foundation]
**Test Location**: src/__tests__/ following established patterns from SecurityNotificationService tests
**Coverage Requirements**: Comprehensive coverage of schema changes, model relationships, and constraint validation

**Required Test Cases**:
- Migration application and rollback tests
- Model relationship integrity tests (Contact ↔ PaymentSource ↔ ReconciliationLog)
- Unique constraint enforcement on transactionFingerprint and hashedIdentifier
- Index performance validation with sample data
- Foreign key constraint validation
- Prisma client generation with new model types
- Database query performance tests for reconciliation operations
