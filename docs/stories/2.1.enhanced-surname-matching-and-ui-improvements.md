# Story 2.1: Enhanced Surname Matching and UI Improvements

## Status
Approved

## Story

**As a** System Administrator,
**I want** the Lloyds data matching system to use intelligent surname-based fuzzy matching with better visual interfaces for contact review and editing,
**so that** I can accurately match unstructured Lloyds payment descriptions to GHL contacts and have a modern, consistent UI experience across the application.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. On reconciliation page load, system compiles an indexed list of all surnames from the contact dataset for fast lookup
2. When processing Lloyds payment data, system searches description field for any surname matches using fuzzy matching logic
3. Surname matches are enhanced with forename matching including common abbreviations (e.g., "J Smith" matches "John Smith")
4. System provides "pop out" functionality to view potential matches in a new tab with editable contact details
5. Contact editing interface in new tab uses modern UI design consistent with reconciliation dashboard styling
6. /all-contacts page is restyled with modern UI design matching the reconciliation dashboard aesthetic
7. /all-contacts modal popup is improved with better layout and modern styling
8. /users page is restyled with modern UI design matching the reconciliation dashboard
9. User edit areas and new user interface use consistent modern styling
10. All UI improvements maintain existing functionality while enhancing visual design and usability
11. Fuzzy matching handles common name variations (MacDonald/McDonald, Smith/Smyth) and partial matches
12. Performance is maintained with efficient surname indexing and search algorithms

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
From Epic 1 completion: The reconciliation system is fully functional with PaymentList, MatchSuggestions, and comprehensive filtering. The MatchingService currently handles Stripe data well but struggles with unstructured Lloyds descriptions. The current UI is highly polished for reconciliation components but legacy pages need modernization.

### Current MatchingService Analysis
**Existing Matching Logic** [Source: src/lib/MatchingService.ts]:
- Lines 289-322: `extractNamesFromDescription()` uses regex patterns for name extraction
- Lines 394-431: Levenshtein distance calculation for fuzzy matching
- Lines 197-227: `calculateNameMatch()` prioritizes customer_name then falls back to description parsing
- Current patterns target structured descriptions, not ideal for Lloyds data

### Enhanced Surname Matching Strategy
**Surname Index Architecture** [Source: Technical Requirements]:
- Build surname index on reconciliation page load (acceptable with few hundred contacts)
- Extract unique surnames from contact dataset: `contact.lastName` and parsed `contact.name` 
- Create normalized surname mappings for common variations
- Use in-memory Map/Set for O(1) surname lookup performance
- Index structure: `Map<normalizedSurname, Contact[]>` for efficient matching

**Fuzzy Matching Enhancement** [Source: Existing Levenshtein implementation]:
- Extend existing `calculateLevenshteinSimilarity()` for surname detection
- Search Lloyds descriptions for any text matching surname index entries
- Apply fuzzy matching with configurable threshold (0.8 for high confidence)
- When surname match found, attempt forename enhancement:
  - Extract potential forenames near matched surname
  - Handle abbreviations: "J" → "John", "M" → "Michael", etc.
  - Use existing contact `firstName` data for abbreviation expansion

### Contact Pop-Out Interface Design
**New Tab Architecture** [Source: Next.js routing patterns]:
- Create route: `/contact-review/[id]` for pop-out contact interface
- Use modern card layout with tabbed sections (Details, Custom Fields, Notes)
- Implement inline editing with save/cancel functionality
- Follow reconciliation dashboard styling: Tailwind CSS with consistent color scheme
- Component structure: `ContactReviewPage` → `EditableContactForm` → field components

**Integration with Existing Match Flow** [Source: MatchSuggestions component]:
- Add "View Details" button to each match suggestion
- Use `window.open()` to launch new tab with contact review interface
- Pass contact ID and return context for seamless workflow integration

### UI Modernization Strategy
**Design System Elements** [Source: reconciliation dashboard analysis]:
- Color palette: Modern grays with accent colors
- Typography: Clean, readable font stack
- Card-based layouts with subtle shadows and rounded corners
- Consistent button styling and hover states
- Form elements with proper focus states and validation feedback

**Pages Requiring Updates** [Source: Project structure analysis]:
- `/all-contacts` → `src/app/all-contacts/page.tsx` and `client.tsx`
- Modal components → `src/components/ContactEditForm.tsx` and `FullContactEditForm.tsx`
- `/users` → `src/app/users/page.tsx` 
- User editing interfaces throughout the application

### Performance Considerations
**Surname Index Performance** [Source: System constraints]:
- Contact dataset: ~few hundred records (manageable in memory)
- Index build time: <100ms for typical dataset size
- Memory usage: <1MB for surname index structure
- Refresh strategy: Rebuild index when contact data changes

**UI Performance** [Source: Modern web standards]:
- Use CSS-in-JS or Tailwind classes for consistent performance
- Implement proper loading states for contact data fetching
- Add debounced search for any new search functionality
- Maintain existing pagination performance in modernized views

### Technical Integration Points
**MatchingService Updates** [Source: src/lib/MatchingService.ts]:
- Add `SurnameIndex` class for managing surname data
- Modify `extractNamesFromDescription()` to use surname index lookup
- Enhance `calculateNameMatch()` with surname-first matching logic
- Update confidence weighting to favor surname matches for Lloyds data

**API Endpoints** [Source: Existing API structure]:
- Extend `/api/contacts/[id]/route.ts` for contact updates from pop-out interface
- Consider adding `/api/contacts/surnames` endpoint for surname index data
- Ensure proper error handling and validation for contact updates

**Component Architecture** [Source: src/components structure]:
- Create `SurnameMatchingProvider` context for surname index management
- Build `ContactPopOut` component with modern design patterns
- Update existing components with consistent styling approach
- Maintain separation of concerns between logic and presentation

### File Structure Updates
**New Files to Create** [Source: Project organization]:
