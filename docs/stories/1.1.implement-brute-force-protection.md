# Story 1.1: Implement brute-force protection

## Status
Done

## Story

**As a** System Administrator,
**I want** brute-force protection (e.g., account lockout) implemented for the NextAuth authentication system,
**so that** the application is protected from automated password attacks and unauthorized access attempts.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. After 5 failed login attempts, the account should be locked for 15 minutes
2. Account lockout should reset after successful authentication
3. Failed login attempts should be tracked and stored in the database
4. Security events should be logged for monitoring and alerting
5. Account lockout should not reveal whether the username exists (prevent enumeration)
6. The system should handle concurrent login attempts gracefully
7. Configuration should be environment-variable driven for flexibility

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Verify existing AuthService implementation meets requirements (AC: 1, 2, 3, 6)
  - [x] Review AuthService lockout logic and timing
  - [x] Verify failed attempt tracking in database
  - [x] Test concurrent access handling
  - [x] Validate environment variable configuration
  
- [x] Task 2: Verify database schema supports brute-force protection (AC: 3)
  - [x] Confirm User model has failedLoginAttempts field
  - [x] Confirm User model has lockedUntil field
  - [x] Verify proper indexing for performance
  
- [x] Task 3: Verify NextAuth integration (AC: 1, 2, 5)
  - [x] Review auth.ts integration with AuthService
  - [x] Test account lockout flow
  - [x] Verify username enumeration protection
  - [x] Test lockout expiration logic
  
- [x] Task 4: Verify security event logging (AC: 4)
  - [x] Review SecurityNotificationService integration
  - [x] Verify SecurityEvent model and logging
  - [x] Test security event creation for failed logins
  
- [x] Task 5: Add comprehensive testing (AC: All)
  - [x] Create unit tests for AuthService methods
  - [x] Create integration tests for auth flow with lockouts
  - [x] Test edge cases and error handling
  - [x] Verify configuration flexibility

### Previous Story Insights
This is the first story in the epic, so no previous story context applies.

### Current Implementation Analysis
**CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: The brute-force protection functionality appears to be **ALREADY IMPLEMENTED** in the current codebase. Analysis shows:

**Existing AuthService Implementation** [Source: src/lib/AuthService.ts]:
- Complete brute-force protection with configurable MAX_FAILED_ATTEMPTS (default: 5)
- Account lockout with configurable LOCKOUT_DURATION_MINUTES (default: 15)
- Methods: `isAccountLocked()`, `incrementFailedAttempts()`, `resetFailedAttempts()`, `getLockoutEndTime()`
- Proper error handling and security considerations (no username enumeration)

**Database Schema Support** [Source: prisma/schema.prisma]:
- User model includes `failedLoginAttempts Int @default(0)`
- User model includes `lockedUntil DateTime?`
- SecurityEvent model exists with comprehensive event tracking
- Proper indexing on security-related fields

**NextAuth Integration** [Source: src/lib/auth.ts]:
- AuthService is already integrated into NextAuth authorize function
- Account lockout checking before authentication
- Failed attempt increment on authentication failure
- Successful login resets failed attempts
- Proper error messages without username enumeration

**Security Event Logging** [Source: src/lib/SecurityNotificationService.ts]:
- Complete SecurityNotificationService with event logging
- Integration with EmailService for security notifications
- Event types: failed_login, successful_login_after_failures, new_ip_login, suspicious_pattern
- Severity levels and notification throttling

### Technical Context
**Authentication Architecture** [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack-alignment.md]:
- NextAuth version 4.24.11 target
- Credentials provider implementation
- JWT session strategy with 24-hour expiry

**Integration Approach** [Source: docs/architecture/enhancement-scope-and-integration-strategy.md]:
- Security modifications are part of foundational security model changes
- No breaking changes to existing APIs required
- Existing middleware.ts for route protection

### File Locations
**Existing Implementation Files**:
- `src/lib/AuthService.ts` - Complete brute-force protection service
- `src/lib/SecurityNotificationService.ts` - Security event logging and notifications
- `src/lib/auth.ts` - NextAuth configuration with AuthService integration
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Database schema with User and SecurityEvent models

**Testing Requirements**:
- No specific testing guidance found in architecture docs
- Need to establish testing patterns for security services
- Test location should follow existing patterns in src/__tests__/

### Testing

**Framework**: Jest & React Testing Library [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack-alignment.md - New Technology Additions]
**Test Location**: src/__tests__/ following established patterns from existing codebase
**Coverage Requirements**: All brute-force protection functionality must be tested including edge cases

**Required Test Cases**:
- AuthService lockout logic with various attempt counts
- Account lockout expiration and reset
- Concurrent login attempt handling
- NextAuth integration with AuthService
- Security event logging for failed login attempts
- Configuration flexibility with environment variables

**Test Validation Approach**:
- Unit tests for AuthService methods
- Integration tests for complete authentication flow with lockouts
- Edge case testing for boundary conditions
- Security testing to verify no username enumeration
