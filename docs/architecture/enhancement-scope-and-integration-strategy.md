# Enhancement Scope and Integration Strategy

## Enhancement Overview

  * **Enhancement Type**: New Feature Addition (Reconciliation Dashboard), Major Feature Modification (Security Overhaul), and New System Integration (WordPress).
  * **Scope**: To create a secure, semi-automated dashboard for reconciling membership payments from bank/Stripe reports and automatically updating member roles in GHL and WordPress.
  * **Integration Impact**: **Significant**. This introduces a new core feature, modifies the foundational security model, and adds a new external integration.

## Integration Approach

  * **Code Integration**: New functionality will be built within the existing Next.js monorepo structure. New frontend components will reside in a new `src/app/admin/reconciliation/` directory, backend logic in `src/lib/`, and API routes in a new `src/app/api/reconciliation/` directory. The existing `middleware.ts` will be modified to protect these new admin routes.
  * **Database Integration**: A new Prisma migration will be created to add any fields required for the security overhaul and reconciliation tracking (e.g., for hashed bank account numbers). All database interactions will continue to use the existing Prisma client (`src/lib/prisma.ts`).
  * **API Integration**: The enhancement will consume the existing GHL API via `src/lib/ghl-api.ts` and will require a new client service for interacting with the WordPress REST API.
  * **UI Integration**: The new dashboard will be a new page within the existing application, reusing shared components from `src/components/` and existing Tailwind CSS styles to ensure a consistent look and feel.

## Compatibility Requirements

  * **Existing Functionality**: The enhancement must not introduce any breaking changes to existing APIs or negatively impact the performance or functionality of the current application.
  * **Database Schema**: All database schema changes must be backward compatible and applied via incremental, reversible migrations.
  * **WordPress**: The solution must be compatible with WordPress v6.8.2 and operate correctly with the Wordfence security plugin active.
