# Story 1.11: Main Interactive UI for Match Suggestions

## Status
Approved

## Story

**As a** System Administrator,
**I want** an interactive interface that displays uploaded payment data and AI-powered match suggestions with GHL contacts,
**so that** I can efficiently review and confirm payment-to-contact matches to complete the reconciliation process.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Admin can view a list of uploaded payment transactions in the Payment Processing tab
2. Admin can select individual payments to see AI-powered contact match suggestions
3. Match suggestions display contact details, confidence scores, and matching reasoning
4. Admin can confirm a match between payment and GHL contact with a single action
5. Interface provides clear feedback when matches are confirmed successfully
6. Confirmed matches trigger updates to both GHL and WordPress systems automatically
7. Interface handles API errors gracefully with user-friendly error messages
8. Payment data displays all relevant transaction information (amount, date, description, source)
9. Match suggestions are sorted by confidence score (highest first)
10. Interface integrates seamlessly within the existing ReconciliationDashboard tabbed structure

## Dev Notes

### Data Persistence Gap Identified
**Critical Issue**: Currently uploaded payment data exists only in memory during the upload process. There is no persistence mechanism to store parsed payment data for later processing in the Payment Processing and Match Suggestions workflow.

**Required Data Persistence Strategy**:
- Payment data must be stored in database after successful upload
- Need API endpoint to retrieve persisted payment data for display
- Must handle payment status tracking (pending, matched, confirmed)
- Should maintain relationship between uploaded file and individual payment records

### API Specifications and Integration
**NEW: Payment Data Persistence API**:
- **MISSING**: `/api/reconciliation/payments` GET endpoint to retrieve stored payment data
- **UPDATE NEEDED**: `/api/reconciliation/upload` POST endpoint must persist payment data to database
- **REQUIRED**: Payment status tracking and lifecycle management
- **CONSIDERATION**: Database schema updates needed for payment storage

**Matches API Endpoint** [Source: src/app/api/reconciliation/matches/route.ts]:
- Endpoint: `POST /api/reconciliation/matches` and `GET /api/reconciliation/matches`
- POST Request body: `{ paymentData: ParsedPaymentData }`
- GET Query parameters: `transactionFingerprint`, `amount`, `paymentDate`, `source`, `description`
- Response: `{ success: boolean, suggestions: any[], totalMatches: number, processingTimeMs: number, message: string }`
- Admin authentication required via NextAuth session
- Uses MatchingService for intelligent contact matching

**Confirm API Endpoint** [Source: src/app/api/reconciliation/confirm/route.ts]:
- Endpoint: `POST /api/reconciliation/confirm`
- Request body: `{ paymentData: ParsedPaymentData, contactId: string, confidence: number, reasoning?: any }`
- Response: `{ success: boolean, reconciliationLogId: string, ghlUpdateResult: any, wordpressUpdateResult: any, errors?: string[] }`
- Admin authentication required via NextAuth session
- Uses ReconciliationService for complete match confirmation workflow
- Automatically updates both GHL and WordPress systems

### Data Models and Types
**Existing Type Definitions** [Source: src/components/reconciliation/types.ts]:
- `PaymentData`: transactionFingerprint, amount, paymentDate, description, source, transactionRef
- `ContactMatch`: contactId, confidence, reasoning (nameMatch, emailMatch, amountMatch), contact details
- `MatchSuggestion`: paymentData, matches array, status ('pending' | 'confirmed' | 'rejected')
- `UploadResponse`: success, data, processed counts from upload operation

**Additional Types Needed**:
- Component state interfaces for PaymentList and MatchSuggestions
- API response types for matches and confirm endpoints
- Loading and error state management types

### Frontend Architecture Requirements
**Component Structure** [Source: docs/architecture/component-architecture.md]:
- `PaymentList.tsx`: Display uploaded payment transactions in `src/components/reconciliation/`
- `MatchSuggestions.tsx`: Show AI-powered match suggestions in `src/components/reconciliation/`
- Integration with existing `ReconciliationDashboard.tsx` component
- Follow established patterns in reconciliation directory structure

**Technology Stack** [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack-alignment.md]:
- React 19.1.1 for building interactive UI components
- Next.js 14.2.31 App Router for client-side API integration
- TypeScript 5.9.2 with strict mode for type safety
- Tailwind CSS v4.1.11 for consistent component styling

### Backend Service Architecture
**MatchingService Integration** [Source: docs/architecture/component-architecture.md]:
- Service location: `src/lib/MatchingService.ts`
- Provides intelligent contact matching against GHL contact database
- Returns match suggestions with confidence scores and reasoning
- Handles name matching, email matching, and amount validation logic

**ReconciliationService Integration** [Source: docs/architecture/component-architecture.md]:
- Service location: `src/lib/ReconciliationService.ts`
- Orchestrates complete reconciliation process after match confirmation
- Updates both GHL contact records and WordPress user roles
- Creates audit trail in ReconciliationLog database table
- Handles rollback scenarios for failed integrations

### UI Integration Requirements
**Dashboard Integration** [Source: existing ReconciliationDashboard.tsx analysis]:
- Payment Processing tab currently has placeholder content - replace with PaymentList component
- Match Suggestions tab currently has placeholder content - replace with MatchSuggestions component
- Existing state management: `uploadSuccess` contains processed payment data
- Tab navigation: `activeTab` state controls which component is displayed
- Existing error handling: `uploadError` state for dashboard-level error display

**UPDATED Data Flow Requirements** [Source: Epic 1 workflow with persistence]:
1. User uploads CSV in Upload tab → CSV parsed and payment data persisted to database
2. User navigates to Payment Processing tab → PaymentList fetches persisted payments from `/api/reconciliation/payments`
3. User selects payment → Navigate to Match Suggestions tab with selected payment data
4. MatchSuggestions fetches AI match suggestions from `/api/reconciliation/matches`
5. User confirms match → API call to `/api/reconciliation/confirm`, update payment status to confirmed

### Styling and User Experience
**Design Consistency** [Source: existing dashboard components analysis]:
- Follow existing dark mode patterns: `dark:bg-gray-800`, `dark:text-gray-100`, `dark:border-gray-700`
- Use existing Tailwind utility classes for layout and spacing
- Match existing card components with `bg-white dark:bg-gray-800` and border styling
- Use existing button patterns and color schemes (blue for primary actions, green for success)

**Responsive Design Requirements** [Source: docs/prd/technical-constraints-and-integration-requirements.md]:
- Must be fully responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile viewports
- Touch-friendly interface elements for tablet/mobile administration
- Maintain usability and readability at all screen sizes
- Support existing keyboard navigation patterns

### Performance and Technical Constraints
**API Performance Requirements** [Source: docs/prd/requirements.md]:
- NFR3: Dashboard reconciliation interface actions must complete under 200ms
- NFR4: Administrator must process typical monthly batch in under 30 minutes
- Implement efficient pagination for large payment lists
- Use optimistic UI updates to improve perceived performance
- Add loading states and progress indicators for longer operations

**Data Security Requirements** [Source: data privacy analysis]:
- All payment data handling must respect existing data privacy rules
- Account numbers already hashed in backend processing - display safely
- Transaction descriptions may contain PII - handle appropriately
- Admin-only access enforced by existing NextAuth middleware

### File Structure and Naming
**Component Files** [Source: existing project structure]:
- `src/components/reconciliation/PaymentList.tsx` - Main payment display component
- `src/components/reconciliation/MatchSuggestions.tsx` - Match suggestions interface
