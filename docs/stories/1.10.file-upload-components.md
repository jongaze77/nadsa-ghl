# Story 1.10: File Upload Components

## Status
Done

## Story

**As a** System Administrator,
**I want** to upload CSV files from both Lloyds Bank and Stripe for payment reconciliation,
**so that** I can process membership payments efficiently through the reconciliation dashboard.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Admin can upload Lloyds Bank CSV files through the reconciliation dashboard
2. Admin can upload Stripe transaction report CSV files through the reconciliation dashboard  
3. File upload interface validates CSV format and file size (10MB limit from existing API)
4. Upload interface provides clear feedback on upload status and validation errors
5. Interface supports both file types with appropriate labeling and instructions
6. Uploaded files are processed through existing `/api/reconciliation/upload` endpoint
7. Component integrates seamlessly with existing ReconciliationDashboard tabbed interface

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**Key learnings from Story 1.9** [Source: docs/stories/1.9.reconciliation-dashboard-ui-shell.md completion notes]:
- ReconciliationDashboard component already exists with tabbed interface (Upload, Payment Processing, Match Suggestions)
- Placeholder FileUpload component already created in `/src/components/reconciliation/FileUpload.tsx`
- TypeScript interfaces for reconciliation data already defined in `/src/components/reconciliation/types.ts`
- Dashboard follows existing admin page patterns with role-based access control
- Dark mode support and Tailwind CSS patterns already established
- Admin route `/admin/reconciliation` already protected and functional

### Backend API Integration
**API Specifications** [Source: src/app/api/reconciliation/upload/route.ts analysis]:
- Upload endpoint: `POST /api/reconciliation/upload`
- Expected FormData fields: `file` (File object), `type` ('lloyds' or 'stripe')
- File validation: CSV format required, 10MB size limit enforced
- Admin role authentication required (already handled by existing middleware)
- Response format: `{ success: boolean, data?: any[], errors?: string[], processed?: number, skipped?: number, message?: string }`
- Integration with CsvParsingService for backend processing

### Frontend Architecture Requirements
**Component Structure** [Source: docs/architecture/component-architecture.md]:
- FileUpload.tsx: Main file upload component in `src/components/reconciliation/`
- Must integrate with ReconciliationDashboard.tsx parent component
- Follow existing patterns established in `src/components/` directory
- Use existing TypeScript interfaces from `types.ts`

**Technology Stack** [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack-alignment.md]:
- React 19.1.1 for building UI components
- Next.js 14.2.31 App Router for client-side functionality
- TypeScript 5.9.2 with strict mode for all new code
- Tailwind CSS v4.1.11 for component styling

### UI Integration Requirements
**Existing UI Integration** [Source: docs/prd/technical-constraints-and-integration-requirements.md]:
- Must integrate seamlessly with established frontend stack of React 19.1.1 and Tailwind CSS v4.1.11
- Reuse existing shared components and styling patterns for consistency
- Must fully support existing dark mode functionality
- Follow existing component organization in `src/components/reconciliation/` directory

**File Upload Requirements** [Source: docs/prd/requirements.md]:
- FR2: Dashboard must provide feature for administrator to upload CSV file from Lloyds Bank
- FR3: Dashboard must provide feature for administrator to upload transaction report from Stripe
- NFR3: Dashboard reconciliation interface must be responsive with actions completing under 200ms
- NFR4: Administrator must process typical monthly batch of payments in under 30 minutes

### Data Models and Types
**Existing Type Definitions** [Source: src/components/reconciliation/types.ts]:
- `UploadedFile` interface: id, name, size, type ('bank_csv' | 'stripe_report'), uploadedAt, status
- `PaymentData` interface: transactionFingerprint, amount, paymentDate, description, source, transactionRef
- File upload component should use these existing interfaces for consistency

### File Structure and Naming
**Directory Structure** [Source: existing project analysis and Story 1.9 completion]:
- Main component: `src/components/reconciliation/FileUpload.tsx` (replace existing placeholder)
- Integration point: `src/components/reconciliation/ReconciliationDashboard.tsx` (update Upload tab)
- Types: `src/components/reconciliation/types.ts` (extend if needed)

**Existing Component Pattern** [Source: src/components/reconciliation/FileUpload.tsx current state]:
- Current placeholder component uses 'use client' directive for client-side functionality
- Follows existing dark mode class patterns: `dark:border-gray-600`, `dark:bg-gray-700`, `dark:text-gray-100`
- Uses Tailwind utility classes for layout and styling

### Technical Constraints
**Styling Consistency** [Source: docs/prd/technical-constraints-and-integration-requirements.md]:
- Adhere to existing visual style defined in Tailwind configuration
- Interactive elements must match style and behavior of existing components
- Support for existing dark mode functionality is mandatory
- Maintain responsive design patterns consistent with current application
- All new TypeScript code must be written in strict mode and pass ESLint rules

## Testing

### Test File Locations
- Component tests: `src/__tests__/components/reconciliation/FileUpload.test.tsx`
- Integration tests: Update existing `src/__tests__/components/reconciliation/ReconciliationDashboard.test.tsx`

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for FileUpload component using React Testing Library
- File validation testing (format, size limits, error handling)
- Upload state management testing (progress, success, error states)
- Integration testing with ReconciliationDashboard component
- API integration testing with mock endpoints
- Dark mode and responsive design testing

### Testing Framework
- Jest & React Testing Library [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack-alignment.md]
- Follow existing testing patterns established in project
- All new frontend components must be accompanied by unit tests
- Note: Some tests may need to be excluded from Jest execution due to testing library dependency issues (consistent with project patterns)
