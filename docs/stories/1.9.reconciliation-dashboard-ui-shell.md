# Story 1.9: Reconciliation Dashboard UI Shell

## Status
Done

## Story

**As a** System Administrator,
**I want** a basic UI shell for the new admin-only Reconciliation Dashboard page,
**so that** I have the foundational structure and navigation to access the reconciliation functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A new admin-only page must be created at `/admin/reconciliation` route
2. The page must be protected by authentication middleware and restricted to admin users only
3. A navigation link to the reconciliation dashboard must be added to the main navigation, visible only to admin role users
4. The basic UI shell must follow existing application styling using Tailwind CSS and support dark mode
5. The dashboard must include placeholder sections for future file upload and payment processing components
6. All new components must integrate seamlessly with existing application structure and patterns

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**Key learnings from Story 1.8** [Source: docs/stories/1.8.ghl-wordpress-update-services.md completion notes]:
- All backend API routes for reconciliation are now complete and available at `/api/reconciliation/`
- ReconciliationService orchestrator and all supporting services are implemented and tested
- Health check endpoint available at `/api/reconciliation/health` for service monitoring
- Comprehensive error handling and logging implemented across all backend services

### Frontend Architecture Requirements
**Component Structure** [Source: docs/architecture/component-architecture.md]:
- ReconciliationDashboard.tsx: Main parent component for the new page in `src/components/reconciliation/`
- FileUpload.tsx, PaymentList.tsx, MatchSuggestions.tsx: Future UI components for dashboard workflow
- All components must follow existing patterns established in `src/components/` directory

**Technology Stack** [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack-alignment.md]:
- React 19.1.1 for building all new UI components
- Next.js 14.2.31 App Router for page routing and structure
- TypeScript 5.9.2 with strict mode for all new code
- Tailwind CSS v4.1.11 for component styling

### UI Integration Requirements
**Existing UI Integration** [Source: docs/prd/user-interface-enhancement-goals.md]:
- Must integrate seamlessly with established frontend stack of React 18 and Tailwind CSS 3.4.1
- Reuse existing shared components from `src/components/` directory for consistency
- New dashboard must be admin-only page with navigation link visible only to admin role users
- Must fully support existing dark mode functionality defined in `tailwind.config.js` and `src/app/globals.css`

**Code Organization** [Source: docs/prd/technical-constraints-and-integration-requirements.md]:
- Dashboard components should reside in `src/app/admin/reconciliation/` and `src/components/reconciliation/`
- All new TypeScript code must be written in strict mode and pass ESLint rules
- Follow existing project structure patterns for consistency

### File Structure and Naming
**Directory Structure** [Source: existing project analysis]:
- Page component: `src/app/admin/reconciliation/page.tsx`
- Main component: `src/components/reconciliation/ReconciliationDashboard.tsx`
- Future components: `src/components/reconciliation/FileUpload.tsx`, `PaymentList.tsx`, `MatchSuggestions.tsx`
- Navigation modification: `src/components/Navigation.tsx`

**Existing Admin Structure** [Source: src/app/admin/ analysis]:
- Follow existing admin page pattern seen in `src/app/admin/security/page.tsx`
- Use consistent authentication and role-checking patterns
- Maintain styling consistency with SecurityDashboard.tsx component

### Authentication and Access Control
**Role-Based Access** [Source: existing Navigation.tsx and admin structure]:
- Use existing session management patterns with NextAuth
- Implement admin role checking consistent with other protected admin pages
- Navigation link visibility controlled by user role (admin only)
- Page protection through existing middleware patterns

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Standards** [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack-alignment.md]:
- Jest & React Testing Library for component and unit testing
- Test files location: `src/__tests__/` following existing patterns
- Unit tests required for all new components to establish testing foundation
- Integration tests for role-based access control and navigation functionality

### Technical Constraints
**Styling Consistency** [Source: docs/prd/user-interface-enhancement-goals.md]:
- Adhere to existing visual style defined in `tailwind.config.js` and `src/app/globals.css`
- Interactive elements must match style and behavior of existing components
- Support for existing dark mode functionality is mandatory
- Maintain responsive design patterns consistent with current application

## Testing

### Test File Locations
- Component tests: `src/__tests__/components/reconciliation/ReconciliationDashboard.test.tsx`
- Page tests: `src/__tests__/app/admin/reconciliation/page.test.tsx`
- Navigation tests: Update existing `src/__tests__/components/Navigation.test.tsx`

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for ReconciliationDashboard component using React Testing Library
- Role-based access control testing for admin-only functionality
- Navigation link visibility and routing tests
- Dark mode and responsive design testing
- Authentication middleware testing for page protection

### Testing Framework
- Jest & React Testing Library [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack-alignment.md]
- Follow existing testing patterns to establish foundation for future development
- All new frontend components must be accompanied by unit tests
