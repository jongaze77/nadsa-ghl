# Story 2.6: Automated GHL Contact Sync with Vercel Cron Jobs

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** NADSA administrator managing membership data,
**I want** automated hourly sync between GHL and the client management app,
**so that** I can access up-to-date contact information without manual intervention and ensure member benefits are applied correctly.

## Business Context

The current manual sync process creates operational inefficiencies for NADSA staff who manage member benefits that depend on accurate, timely contact data. The WordPress website syncs with GHL, but this management app requires manual intervention to stay current. Automated sync ensures:

- Member benefit eligibility is always current
- Staff can trust the data in the management interface
- Reduced manual workload for membership administration
- Improved member experience through timely benefit application

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Incremental Sync Implementation**: System performs hourly incremental sync using GHL API `updatedAt[gt]` parameter to process only contacts modified since last successful sync
2. **Full Reconciliation Sync**: System performs daily full sync at 2 AM to ensure complete data integrity and catch any missed updates
3. **Sync Status Indicator**: Unobtrusive visual indicator shows sync health with Green (< 2 hours), Yellow (2-6 hours), Red (> 6 hours) status levels
4. **Error Handling & Fallback**: Failed syncs are logged with details, system continues normal operation, and manual sync scripts remain fully functional as fallback
5. **API Authentication & Security**: Cron endpoints are properly secured against unauthorized access while respecting GHL API rate limits
6. **Performance & Monitoring**: Sync operations track metrics (contacts processed, duration, errors) and complete within acceptable timeframes
7. **Vercel Cron Integration**: Automated sync runs via Vercel Pro native cron jobs without requiring external services
8. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing manual sync functionality (`npm run sync-contacts`) remains unchanged and operational

## Technical Implementation Details

### **GHL API Integration**
- **Base URL**: `https://rest.gohighlevel.com/v1`
- **Incremental Endpoint**: `/contacts?updatedAt[gt]=${lastSyncISO}&include_custom_fields=true&page=${page}&limit=${limit}`
- **Authentication**: Reuse existing `fetchWithRetry` function with API key and location ID
- **Response Handling**: Process `createdAt` and `updatedAt` timestamps for accurate tracking
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect GHL API quotas and implement appropriate delays

### **Vercel Cron Configuration**
**Important**: Cron jobs must be manually configured in Vercel Dashboard (requires Vercel Pro plan):

1. **Navigate to**: Vercel Project → Settings → Cron Jobs
2. **Create Incremental Sync**:
   - Path: `/api/sync/incremental`
   - Schedule: `0 * * * *` (every hour)
3. **Create Full Sync**:
   - Path: `/api/sync/full`
   - Schedule: `0 2 * * *` (daily at 2 AM)

**Environment Variables**: Add `CRON_SECRET=your-secure-random-string` for additional security

### **Database Schema Extensions**
- Leverage existing `Contact` model fields: `ghlUpdatedAt`, `lastSyncedAt`
- New `SyncOperation` model for tracking operation history and metrics
- Atomic timestamp updates to prevent race conditions during concurrent operations
- Indexed queries for efficient sync status and history retrieval

### **Sync Status Indicator Specifications**
- **Location**: Unobtrusive placement in main navigation header
- **Green Status**: Last successful sync within 2 hours
- **Yellow Status**: Last successful sync 2-6 hours ago (warning state)
- **Red Status**: Last successful sync over 6 hours ago (alert state)
- **Click Behavior**: Opens detailed sync status and history modal/page
- **Real-time Updates**: Status refreshes automatically during sync operations

### **Performance Considerations**
- **Typical Incremental Sync**: 0-5 contacts per hour (very lightweight)
- **API Efficiency**: Only fetch modified contacts using timestamp filtering
- **Database Optimization**: Indexed queries and batch processing for large datasets
- **Monitoring**: Track API usage against GHL quotas and sync operation performance
- **Timeout Handling**: Appropriate timeouts for Vercel serverless function limits
