# Story 1.2: Security Notifications Implementation

## Status
Done

## Story

**As a** System Administrator,
**I want** security notifications to alert admins of suspicious login activity,
**so that** I can be immediately aware of potential security threats and take prompt action to protect the system.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The system must detect and log suspicious login activities (failed login attempts, successful logins after multiple failures, logins from new IP addresses, unusual login patterns)
2. Security events must be stored persistently with comprehensive details (timestamp, username, IP address, user agent, event type, context)
3. Admin users must receive real-time notifications for critical security events via email or system notifications
4. The system must provide a security dashboard/log view for administrators to review security events
5. Notification preferences must be configurable (event types, delivery methods, notification frequency/throttling)
6. The system must integrate seamlessly with existing authentication flow without impacting performance
7. All security logging must comply with privacy requirements (no password logging, appropriate data retention)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**Key learnings from Story 1.1** [Source: docs/stories/1.1.brute-force-protection.md]:
- AuthService architecture established with comprehensive error handling
- Jest testing framework fully configured with 18 test patterns
- NextAuth integration patterns proven with performance considerations
- Environment-configurable security parameters pattern established (MAX_FAILED_ATTEMPTS, LOCKOUT_DURATION_MINUTES)
- Security best practices: no username enumeration, persistent state tracking, comprehensive logging

### Data Models
**Current User Model** [Source: prisma/schema.prisma]:
- id: Int @id @default(autoincrement())  
- username: String @unique
- password: String
- role: String @default("user")
- createdAt: DateTime @default(now())
- failedLoginAttempts: Int @default(0) - Added in Story 1.1
- lockedUntil: DateTime? - Added in Story 1.1

**Required New SecurityEvent Model**:
- id: String @id @default(cuid())
- eventType: String (e.g., 'failed_login', 'successful_login_after_failures', 'new_ip_login', 'suspicious_pattern')
- userId: Int? (nullable for failed attempts on non-existent users)
- username: String (for audit trail even if user doesn't exist)
- ipAddress: String
- userAgent: String?
- timestamp: DateTime @default(now())
- context: Json? (additional event-specific data)
- severity: String (e.g., 'low', 'medium', 'high', 'critical')
- notificationSent: Boolean @default(false)

### Authentication Integration  
**Current NextAuth Configuration** [Source: src/lib/auth.ts]:
- Uses CredentialsProvider with username/password
- AuthService integration established for brute-force protection
- Error handling patterns with appropriate user feedback
- Session strategy: JWT with 24-hour expiry

**Available Context in authorize function**:
- credentials.username, credentials.password
- Request context accessible for IP address and user agent extraction

### Component Specifications
**New SecurityNotificationService Component** [Source: architecture/component-architecture.md#backend-services-in]:
- Location: src/lib/SecurityNotificationService.ts (following AuthService pattern)
- Purpose: Centralized security event detection, logging, and notification management  
- Integration: Called from NextAuth authorize function and potentially other security-sensitive operations

**Email Service Integration**:
- No existing email service - will need to implement
- Consider using environment-configurable SMTP settings
- Follow existing service patterns in src/lib/

### File Locations
**Files to Create**:
- src/lib/SecurityNotificationService.ts - Security event detection and notification logic
- src/lib/EmailService.ts - Email notification delivery service
- src/app/api/admin/security-events/route.ts - API endpoints for security event management
- src/app/admin/security/page.tsx - Security dashboard page
- src/components/security/ - Security dashboard UI components
- Migration file via `npx prisma migrate dev` - SecurityEvent model

**Files to Modify**:
- src/lib/auth.ts - Integrate security event logging into authorize function
- prisma/schema.prisma - Add SecurityEvent model
- src/middleware.ts - Protect admin security routes (if needed)

### Technical Constraints
**Framework Versions** [Source: architecture/tech-stack-alignment.md]:
- NextAuth: 4.24.11 - Will be enhanced with security event logging
- Prisma: 6.13.0 - Handling schema migration and data access  
- TypeScript: 5.9.2 - All new code will be written in TypeScript
- Next.js: Current version - API routes and admin pages

**Integration Requirements** [Source: architecture/enhancement-scope-and-integration-strategy.md]:
- Must not introduce breaking changes to existing APIs
- Database schema changes must be backward compatible via incremental migrations
- Must not negatively impact performance of authentication system
- New admin routes should follow existing admin protection patterns

### Security Requirements
- Security event logging must not expose sensitive data (no passwords, limited PII)
- IP address and user agent logging must comply with privacy requirements
- Notification system must prevent information leakage about system internals
- Event retention policies should be configurable for compliance
- Notification throttling to prevent DOS via excessive security events

### Performance Considerations
- Security event logging must be asynchronous to avoid impacting auth performance
- Batch processing for high-volume security events
- Efficient database indexes for security event queries
- Email notification queuing and rate limiting

## Testing

### Testing Standards
**Framework**: Jest & React Testing Library [Source: Story 1.1 - established testing foundation]
**Test Location**: src/__tests__/ following established patterns from AuthService tests
**Coverage Requirements**: Comprehensive coverage of security event detection, logging, and notification logic

**Required Test Cases**:
- Unit tests for SecurityNotificationService functions (following 18-test pattern from AuthService)
- Integration tests for NextAuth authorize function with security event logging
- Email notification service tests with mock SMTP
- Security dashboard API endpoint tests
- UI component tests for security dashboard
- Performance tests for high-volume security event scenarios
- Error handling and edge case tests
