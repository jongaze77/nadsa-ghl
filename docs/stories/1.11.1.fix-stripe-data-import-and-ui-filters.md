# Story 1.11.1: Fix Stripe Data Import Fields and Add UI Filters

## Status
Done

## Story

**As a** System Administrator,
**I want** the Stripe CSV import to use useful data fields (customer_name, customer_email, card_address_line1, card_address_postal_code) instead of description, preserve pound values correctly (not convert £42 to 0.42), and have filtering capabilities on the /reconciliation screen,
**so that** I can effectively match membership payments (£10, £20, £30) with GHL contacts and the reconciliation system becomes fit for purpose.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Stripe CSV import extracts customer_name, customer_email, card_address_line1, card_address_postal_code instead of description field
2. Currency amounts from gross and Customer_facing_amount fields preserve their pound values (fix incorrect pence conversion that turns £42 into 0.42)
3. /reconciliation screen has amount filtering with preset options for £10, £20, £30 plus custom amount input
4. /reconciliation screen has text search functionality across customer data fields
5. /reconciliation screen has date range filtering for transactions
6. All filtering capabilities work together (combinable filters)
7. Filter results display correctly with proper pagination
8. Import validation ensures data quality for the new fields
9. System gracefully handles missing or malformed data in new fields
10. Currency values are preserved correctly and display properly in UI (£42.00 shows as £42.00, not £0.42)

## Dev Notes

### Critical System Issues Identified
**URGENT**: Current system is not fit for purpose due to data corruption and missing essential functionality. The /reconciliation system cannot effectively match membership payments because:
1. Wrong data fields imported from Stripe (useless description vs. useful customer data)
2. Currency amounts corrupted (£42 stored as 0.42 - incorrect pence conversion)
3. No filtering capabilities to search for specific membership amounts (£10/£20/£30)

### Previous Story Context
From Story 1.11 completion: PaymentList and MatchSuggestions components are fully implemented with comprehensive API integration, but they're working with corrupted/insufficient data from the Stripe import process.

### Stripe CSV Data Structure  
**Current Import Issues** [Source: Analysis of existing CsvParsingService]:
- Currently importing `description` field which is not useful for matching
- Available better fields: `customer_name`, `customer_email`, `card_address_line1`, `card_address_postal_code`
- Amount fields `gross` and `Customer_facing_amount` contain pound values that are being incorrectly treated as pence
- Need to fix incorrect conversion logic: £42 should stay £42, not become £0.42

### Component Integration Points
**PaymentList Component** [Source: src/components/reconciliation/PaymentList.tsx]:
- Already has filtering infrastructure in place from Story 1.11
- Current filters: status, source - need to add amount, text search, date range
- Uses `/api/reconciliation/payments` endpoint which needs filtering parameter support
- Has pagination system that needs to work with new filters
- Component state management ready for additional filter types

**API Endpoint Updates Needed** [Source: src/app/api/reconciliation/payments/route.ts]:
- Add query parameter support for amount filtering
- Add text search parameter for customer fields
- Add date range parameters (dateFrom, dateTo)
- Update database queries to support multiple filter combinations
- Ensure proper SQL query optimization for combined filters

### Data Models and Types Updates
**Payment Data Types** [Source: src/components/reconciliation/types.ts]:
- Add customer_name, customer_email, card_address_line1, card_address_postal_code fields
- Update amount field types to handle proper pound values
- Add filter state interfaces for new filtering capabilities
- Update API response types for enhanced payment data

**Database Schema Considerations** [Source: docs/architecture/data-models-and-schema-changes.md]:
- PendingPayment model may need additional columns for new customer fields
- Ensure proper indexing for search performance on customer fields  
- Consider adding computed fields for search optimization if needed

### Currency Handling Strategy
**Fix Incorrect Conversion Logic** [Source: Technical analysis]:
- Stripe CSV: amounts already in pounds → preserve as-is (NO conversion)
- Current bug: £42 from CSV becomes 0.42 in database (wrong!)
- Correct behavior: £42 from CSV becomes 42.00 in database
- Display format: £XX.XX (always show two decimal places)  
- Database storage: store in pounds as decimal values (no conversion needed)
- Validation: reasonable amount ranges for membership (£5-£500)
- Edge cases: handle zero amounts, negative amounts, very large amounts

### UI Filter Design Requirements
**Filter Layout** [Source: existing PaymentList component analysis]:
- Amount filter: Dropdown with £10/£20/£30 options + custom input
- Text search: Single input searching across all customer fields
- Date range: Date picker component with preset ranges
- Filter combination: All filters work together (AND logic)
- Clear filters: Single button to reset all filters
- Filter persistence: Maintain state during pagination/navigation

### Performance Considerations
**Search Optimization** [Source: API performance requirements]:
- Add database indexes on customer fields for text search
- Implement debounced search (300ms delay) to reduce API calls
- Use proper SQL queries with LIMIT/OFFSET for pagination
- Consider caching frequently used filter combinations
- Monitor query performance with large datasets

### Testing Requirements
**Critical Testing Areas**:
- Stripe CSV parsing with real-world data formats and edge cases
- Currency conversion accuracy and rounding
- Filter combination logic and SQL query correctness
- UI responsiveness with large datasets
- Error handling for malformed CSV data
- Integration testing for complete import-to-filter workflow

### File Structure Updates
**Files to Modify** [Source: existing project structure]:
- `src/lib/CsvParsingService.ts` - Update Stripe field extraction and currency conversion
- `src/components/reconciliation/PaymentList.tsx` - Add new filter controls
